# Setting up Webhooks

Webhooks allow for real-time data to be sent to your application when an event
occurs on models within Jobber.

Webhooks are configured at the application level and will trigger when an
account with an installation performs the topic. As an example, if you've
configured a webhook to listen to `CLIENT_CREATE`, whenever a user creates a new
client, the URL provided will be sent a POST request with the details in the
body. To see what details are sent, see the payload section.

## [delivery permalink](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/using_jobbers_api/setting_up_webhooks\#delivery) Delivery

It is the responsibility of the app developer to monitor that all entered
Webhook URLs can successfully receive an HTTP request. Jobber's Developer Center
does not currently send automated notifications for unexpected Webhook responses
(eg. HTTP status codes outside of the 2xx range).

Webhook requests must be responded to **within 1 second** of receipt. To ensure
adherence to this limit, webhook payloads must be **processed asynchronously** by
the receiving system; your app needs to be resilient to a sudden high volume of
requests.

If an app's response times are outside of this limit, or if a large proportion
of its responses are errors requiring retries, Jobber may disable that app's
webhooks to limit the impact on other apps and systems.

Jobber webhooks provide at-least-once delivery: in certain circumstances the
same webhook **may be sent multiple times**. For example, if initial delivery
appears to fail due to network timeout, the webhook will be re-sent. Apps should
detect duplicate webhooks based on the payload data and handle them in an
idempotent manner.

## [authorization permalink](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/using_jobbers_api/setting_up_webhooks\#authorization) Authorization

To receive webhook data for a topic, you must have the appropriate `read` scope
for that topic. For example, you must have access to read clients to access any
of the `CLIENT_X` topics.

## [supported topics permalink](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/using_jobbers_api/setting_up_webhooks\#supported-topics) Supported Topics

To see a list of supported topics, see `WebHookTopicEnum` in our GraphQL schema.
All supported topics are selectable when creating a webhook in the configuration
of your application.

Examples:

- `CLIENT_CREATE`
- `CLIENT_UPDATE`
- `CLIENT_DESTROY`

## [webhook payload permalink](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/using_jobbers_api/setting_up_webhooks\#webhook-payload) Webhook Payload

The webhook payload sent to the provided URL is introspectable in our GraphQL
schema, see `WebHookPayload` for the most up-to-date payload, which is the
result of the `webHookEvent` query.

Example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "webHookEvent": {
      "topic": "CLIENT_CREATE",
      "appId": "3ef22a50-072d-430c-a78f-b7646657560b",
      "accountId": "MQ==",
      "itemId": "MQ==",
      "occurredAt": "2021-08-12T16:31:36-06:00"
    }
  }
}

```

> ℹ️ The content type for any apps created **before Apr. 11, 2022** is
> `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. The content type for any apps created
> **after Apr. 11, 2022** is `application/json`.

> ℹ️ The payload for any apps created **before Dec. 8, 2023** will have the
> timestamp field named `occuredAt`. This field has been renamed to `occurredAt`
> for any apps created **after Dec. 8, 2023.**

## [verify authenticity of the webhook permalink](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/using_jobbers_api/setting_up_webhooks\#verify-authenticity-of-the-webhook) Verify Authenticity of the Webhook

Before you respond to the webhook, you should verify that the webhook was sent
from Jobber. A calculated signature is sent with every webhook, which you can
use to verify the authenticity of the request.

Each request will include a base64 encoded `X-Jobber-Hmac-SHA256` header, which
is generated using your app's OAuth client secret and the data sent in the
webhook.

Here is an example in Ruby as to how one might verify the request:

```ruby
MY_SECRET = "my app's OAuth client secret"

# 'data' is the raw JSON payload
# 'hmac_header' is the base64 encoded header `X-Jobber-Hmac-SHA256`
def verify_webhook(data, hmac_header)
  digest = OpenSSL::HMAC.digest(OpenSSL::Digest.new('sha256'), MY_SECRET, data)
  calculated_hmac = Base64.strict_encode64(digest)

  # https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/SecurityUtils.html
  # Compare strings of variable length, without exposing yourself to a timing attack
  ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(calculated_hmac, hmac_header)
end

verify_webhook(
  "{\"data\":{\"webHookEvent\":{\"topic\":\"APP_CONNECT\",\"appId\":\"id\",\"accountId\":\"id\",\"itemId\":\"id\",\"occurredAt\":\"ISO8601DateTime\"}}}",
  "ks1dre6TCHsMO2GVWnDYmx3ZrxubXGbCNZ5gPiXvP9E="
)
# => returns boolean value which determines authenticity

```
