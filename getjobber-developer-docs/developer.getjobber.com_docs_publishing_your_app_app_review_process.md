# App Review Process

## [submit an app for review permalink](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/publishing_your_app/app_review_process\#submit-an-app-for-review) Submit an App for Review

In order to publish your app to Jobber's marketplace, allowing service providers
to connect and use your app, your app must first be tested, reviewed, and
approved by Jobber. When you submit your app, we will ask you to complete our
[App Pre-Submission Checklist](https://forms.gle/etnZAQN8F6X62GyMA). For more
information about the app testing process, see the
[Testing An App](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/building_your_app/testing_your_app/) section. You can
request a review of your app by clicking on the three dots action menu next to
your app in the Manage Apps view. If you do not intend to publish your app in
Jobber's App Marketplace, see the
[Custom Integrations](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/custom_integrations/) section.

## [cancel a review permalink](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/publishing_your_app/app_review_process\#cancel-a-review) Cancel a Review

If you wish to cancel a requested review for whatever reason, you can simply
cancel a review in a similar manner to above. In the apps list view, click on
the three dots, and there will be a button which allows you to cancel a
requested review.

## [what to expect after requesting a review permalink](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/publishing_your_app/app_review_process\#what-to-expect-after-requesting-a-review) What to Expect After Requesting a Review

After having submitted your app for review, Jobber will review your app and
follow up with you at the email address associated to your account on the
Developer Center to discuss next steps and the testing process. From there, we
will discuss details on anything that may require changing in order to best fit
in with Jobber's ecosystem. Jobber has a very high standard for app quality and
we strive for great user experience in all apps released to Jobber's App
Marketplace.

If your app meets our acceptance level of quality its state will be changed from
"in\_review" to "approved". It will not yet appear in Jobber's App Marketplace
right away though. You will receive a follow up email from Jobber to discuss
next steps and timing of the app release.

> ℹ️ Please do not make any announcements or website updates about the
> app/integration before the app is moved into "published" state and is made
> publicly visible to all. If you are planning any announcements, press releases,
> or social media posts that mention Jobber or include our logo, we would like to
> review them first.
